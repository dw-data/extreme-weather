## Datasets

The file `Database.xlsx` contains the data our analysis is based on, as well as a complete list of sources used.

The file `script.Rmd` contains the code used to analyze the CDP and World Risk Report data.


## Data Sources

- [CDP 2023 Cities Climate Hazards Questionnaire](https://data.cdp.net/Climate-Hazards/2023-Cities-Climate-Hazards/rng4-m4ks/about_data): A dataset containing self-reported information from over 1000 cities on climate action plans, current and future climate impacts and more. We focused on cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. Data was used to gather information about which climate hazards impact cities most and which groups cities consider most vulnerable to those hazards.
- [World Risk Report trend dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/worldriskindex): The base dataset behind the [world risk report](https://weltrisikobericht.de/worldriskreport/) was used to visualize how many people are statistically affected by flooding each year, and how vulnerable countries are to such climate hazards.
- [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/insights/future-extreme-heat-cities-data): This analysis by the World Resources Institute, based on IPCC data, was used to visualize how many additional hot days cities might face under a 2 degree global warming scenario.
- [Verisk Maplecroft Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index](https://www.maplecroft.com/global-risk-data/climate-risk-data/): An excerpt of this dataset was provided to DW to show the climate risk level faced by each region's biggest cities in 2050 under a middle-emissions scenario (SSP2 4.5)
